# HTTP/2 is automatically enabled on Netlify with HTTPS
# HTTP/2 provides:
# - Multiplexing: Multiple requests over a single connection
# - Header compression: Reduces overhead (HPACK)
# - Server push: Proactively send resources (if configured)
# - Binary protocol: More efficient than HTTP/1.1
# 
# These headers optimize HTTP/2 performance
